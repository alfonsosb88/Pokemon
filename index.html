  <p>At the beginning of their quest, Trainers are given a starter Pokemon.
  This Pokemon will be used to battle the first wild Pokemon that the Trainer encounters.
  Once another Pokemon is caught, the starter Pokemon may be retired, but it is often with this Pokemon that Trainers learn friendship and trust.
  As such, even advanced Trainers may still use their starter Pokemon, and they will often be the most powerful Pokemon on their respective teams.
  In the core series games, it is said that the starter Pokemon are extremely rare, giving the player a reason why the Pokemon not chosen can't be found in the wild.

<p><strong>Charmander</strong> is a bipedal, reptilian Pokemon with a primarily orange body.
  Its underside from the chest down and soles are cream-colored.
  It has two small fangs visible in both its upper and lower jaws and blue eyes.
  Its arms and legs are short with four fingers and three clawed toes.
  A fire burns at the tip of this Pokemon's slender tail, and has blazed there since Charmander's birth.
  The flame can be used as an indication of Charmander's health and mood, burning brightly when the Pokemon is strong, weakly when it is exhausted,
  wavering when it is happy, and blazing when it is enraged.
  It is said that Charmander dies if its flame goes out.
  However, if the Pokemon is healthy, the flame will continue to burn if gets a bit wet and is said to steam in the rain.
  Charmander can be found in hot, mountainous areas.
  However, it is found far more often in the ownership of Trainers.
  As shown in Pokemon Snap, Charmander exhibits pack behavior, calling others of its species if it finds food.

<p><strong>Squirtle</strong> is a small Pokemon that resembles a light blue turtle.
  While it typically walks on its two short legs, it has been shown to run on all fours in Super Smash Bros. Brawl.
  It has large brown eyes and a slightly hooked upper lip.
  Each of its hands and feet have three pointed digits.
  The end of its long tail curls inward.
  Its body is encased by a tough shell that forms and hardens after birth.
  This shell is brown on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and has a thick white ridge between the two halves.
  Squirtle's shell is a useful tool.
  It can withdraw into the shell for protection or for sleeping, and its grooved, rounded shape helps to reduce water resistance when this Pokemon swims.
  Squirtle can spray foamy water from its mouth with great accuracy.
  Squirtle is scarce in the wild, although it can be found around small ponds and lakes.
  The anime has shown that it can be found living on secluded islands with other members of its evolutionary line.

<div class="bulbasaur-bio">

  <p><strong>Bulbasaur</strong> is a small, quadruped Pokemon that has blue-green skin with darker green patches.
    It has red eyes with white pupils and pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head.
    Its snout is short and blunt, and it has a wide mouth.
    A pair of small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open.
    Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws.
    On its back is a green plant bulb, which is grown from a seed planted there at birth.
    The bulb provides it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.
    As mentioned in the anime, starter Pokemon are raised by Breeders to be distributed to new Trainers.
    Having been domesticated from birth, Bulbasaur is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved Pokemon.
    It is known to be extremely loyal, even after long-term abandonment.
    Bulbasaur has also shown itself to be an excellent caretaker, even having a special technique called the "Bulba-by."
    To perform this technique, Bulbasaur uses its vines to pick up a young Pokemon and soothingly rocks it in the air.
    It is found in grasslands and forests throughout the Kanto region.
    However, due to Bulbasaur's status as starter Pokemon, it is hard to come by in the wild and generally found under the ownership of a Trainer.
    It has been observed that a Bulbasaur's bulb will flash blue when it is ready to evolve.
    If it does not want to evolve, it struggles to resist the transformation.
    Many Bulbasaur gather every year in a hidden garden in Kanto to evolve into Ivysaur in a ceremony led by a Venusaur.
